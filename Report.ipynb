        "The paper shows that replacing the max-pooling with the convolutional with increased strides can improve the performance. The authors prove it by training models with max-pooling, models removing max-pooling, and models replacing max-pooling with convolutional layers. The results show the models replacing max-pooling with convolutional layers with strides generally have better performance. \n",

        "## *Model, Strided-CNN, ConvPool-CNN, and ALL-CNN?*\n",
        "Each model base has one original model and thee branches. **“Model”** is the model with max-pooling. **“Strided-CNN”** is the model removing max-pooling. **“All-CNN”** is the model replacing max-pooling with convolutional strides. The better performance of “All-CNN” might result from more parameters than “Model” and “Strided-CNN”. To solve it, “ConvPool-CNN” is proposed. **“ConvPool-CNN”** is the model with max-pooling and one more convolutional layer before the pooling. “ConvPool-CNN” should have the same number of parameters as “All-CNN”. Therefore, if “All-CNN” has a better performance than “ConvPool-CNN”, we can prove the better performance on “All-CNN” does not result from more parameters. \n",

        "Since the design of convolutional layers would influence the performance, the authors test three model bases. The model A uses the 5x5 strides. The model B uses the 5x5 strides but also adds one convolutional layer with 1x1 strides after that. The model C uses two convolutional layers with 3x3 strides. \n",

        "Three model bases and three branches in each base are designed, so there are 12 models in total. These models are trained on the CIFAR-10 with the stochastic gradient descent with a fixed momentum of 0.9 and 350 epochs. The learning rate γ is chosen from the set ∈ [0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01]. It is also scheduled by multiplying with a fixed factor of 0.1 in the epoch S= [200, 250, 300]. The paper only presents the best performance among all learning rates. Based on the source code, the performance is directly evaluated on the CIFAR-10 test set. **No cross-validation is conducted to evaluate the hyperparameters!**  \n",
