        "The paper shows that replacing the max-pooling with the convolutional with increased strides can improve the performance. The authors prove it by training models with max-pooling, models removing max-pooling, and models replacing max-pooling with convolutional layers. The results show the models replacing max-pooling with convolutional layers with strides generally have better performance. We provide the detail explanation as follows. The authors tested 12 networks by designing 3 model bases and 3 branches. \n",
        "\n",
        "## *Base: Model A, Model B, and Model C*\n",
        "Since the design of convolutional layers would influence the performance, the authors test three model bases. **Model A** uses the 5x5 strides. **Model B** uses the 5x5 strides but also adds one convolutional layer with 1x1 strides after that. **Model C** uses two convolutional layers with 3x3 strides. \n",
        "\n",
        "## *Branch: Model, Strided-CNN, ConvPool-CNN, and ALL-CNN*\n",
        "Each model base has one original model and thee branches. **“Model”** is the model with max-pooling. **“Strided-CNN”** is the model removing max-pooling. **“All-CNN”** is the model replacing max-pooling with convolutional strides. The better performance of “All-CNN” might result from more parameters than “Model” and “Strided-CNN”. To solve it, “ConvPool-CNN” is proposed. **“ConvPool-CNN”** is the model with max-pooling and one more convolutional layer before the pooling. “ConvPool-CNN” should have the same number of parameters as “All-CNN”. Therefore, if “All-CNN” has a better performance than “ConvPool-CNN”, we can prove the better performance on “All-CNN” does not result from more parameters. \n",

        "All 12 networks are trained on the CIFAR-10 with the stochastic gradient descent with a fixed momentum of 0.9 and 350 epochs. The learning rate γ is chosen from the set ∈ [0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01]. It is also scheduled by multiplying with a fixed factor of 0.1 in the epoch S= [200, 250, 300]. The paper only presents the best performance among all learning rates. Based on the source code, the performance is directly evaluated on the CIFAR-10 test set. **The source code did not use the cross-validation for hyper-parameter tuning!** \n",
